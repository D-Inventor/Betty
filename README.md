# Betty
Betty is my personal bot assistant on Discord. Betty is timezone aware and contains functionality that can help server owners to manage their server.


# TODO
- save agenda to filesystem and restore agenda on reboot.
    Betty can plan an event and give notifications, but forgets all appointments when she restarts.
- add configurable security layers for better command control.
    Server owners should at least be able to select roles for 3 security layers.
    Ideally the server owner can specify by him/herself how many security layers there are, and which commands can be executed by each layer.
