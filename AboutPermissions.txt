How do permissions work?

Some commands require users to have particular permissions.
Permissions are inclusive, which means that higher permissions only add upon a lower permission

How do permission changes work

Permission are applied on users or on roles.
For a user to gain a certain permission...
	- ...this user has to gain a role that has at least this permission
	- ...this user has to gain at least this permission from somebody with a permission that is higher than the desired permission

For a user to lose a certain permission...
	- ...the calling user has to have a higher permission than the permission of given user.
